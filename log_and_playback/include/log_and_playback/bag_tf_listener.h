/** A TransformListener that is convenient to use with bags.
 *
 * The TF tree can be updated directly from ApplanixPose/LocalizePose messages,
 * and static transforms can be added to it.
 *
 * Considering the global frame transforms ("utm" -> "local_utm" -> "smooth"):
 * - initially those are updated from the ApplanixPose using the fake localizer,
 *   unless useLocalizePose() was called.
 * - when a LocalizePose message is added (addLocalizePose), the localizer is
 *   reset and the global transforms are subsequently updated from the
 *   LocalizePose messages only.
 * This allows to conditionally work with LocalizePose messages, when not sure
 * whether they will be available.
